<h1>Hello, this is my first Django website, so please be kind</h1>
<br/>
<h2>This part of the website has been created to let you know what is this all about</h2>
<h3>I've created this website as a sort of a practice for the future.
  Basically, this webpage will receive a text and tell you how many words does it have.</h3>

  <h4>Thank you for testing it. Have a nice day!</h4>
